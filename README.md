# Real-Estate-Price-Predictions

This project explores a classic **real estate prediction** dataset using Python. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling, it aims to predict house prices per unit area based on location, proximity to amenities, and other property features.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes information such as house age, distance to MRT, number of convenience stores, and geolocation.
- Target variable: **House price per unit area (Y)**

## Objectives
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and correlations.
- Apply **machine learning models** like Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, KNN, and SVR.
- Use **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and investigate its impact on model performance.
- Evaluate models using **RÂ² scores** and **visualizations**.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Python scripts
- StandardScaler, PCA, regression models from sklearn

## Key Learnings
- How different property features influence price
- How PCA can reduce dimensionality and impact performance
- Model comparison and tuning basics
